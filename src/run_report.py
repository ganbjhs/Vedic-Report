"""Capture runner (X-only): read a list of X/Twitter post links, screenshot each
one in the logged-in browser, verify the shots, write results.json.

Capture runs in PARALLEL across worker processes, so many links are
screenshotted concurrently instead of one-by-one.

Source resolution (first match wins):
    1. a CLI argument: an .xlsx path, or "-" to paste links on stdin
    2. config/links.xlsx       (default)

Usage:
    python src/run_report.py links.xlsx
    python src/run_report.py -                      # paste links, Ctrl-D
    python src/run_report.py --workers 6            # more parallelism
    python src/run_report.py --headed               # watch the browser
    python src/run_report.py --keep-engagement      # keep the like/views line

By default the shot is cropped above the engagement bar. `--keep-engagement`
keeps it — on a comment link that means the parent's like/views line AND the
comment's own, both in frame.

The X login comes from sessions/x_state.json — create it once with:
    python src/save_sessions.py x
