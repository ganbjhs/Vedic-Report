"""Upload handling: parse → validate → normalize to a canonical .xlsx.

Why normalize instead of handing the raw upload to the pipeline:

  * `src/input_loader.py` routes every path through `load_excel`, which needs a
    real .xlsx. A legacy binary `.xls` fails the zip check and is then read as
    text — producing garbage. A `.tsv` is parsed with csv's *comma* dialect, so
    "Name<TAB>URL" collapses into one cell and the link comes out as
    "Name\\thttps://…". Normalizing here fixes both **without editing the frozen
    loader** (rule #1).
  * It lets us reject a bad file with a useful message *before* a job is queued,
    and show the user how many links were found.

The layout logic itself (header row vs plain list, running category headers, URL
cleanup, X-only filtering) is NOT reimplemented — we build a grid and hand it to
the frozen `input_loader._rows_from_grid`, so the web app and the CLI agree on
exactly what a given sheet means.
