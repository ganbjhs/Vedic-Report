"""Capture dispatcher (X-only).

    from capture import capture
    res = capture(page, url, shot_path)     # screenshots one X post

x_capture.capture(page, url, shot_path) -> result dict
(status / handle / screenshot / text). The dispatcher just stamps the platform.

`keep_engagement` is passed straight through: False (the default) crops the
like/views line out, True keeps it — see x_capture's docstring. `fast` is passed
through the same way (approved edit 6c) and defaults to the behaviour that was
here before it existed.
