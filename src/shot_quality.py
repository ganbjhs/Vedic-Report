"""Decide whether a tweet screenshot actually captured the post, or came out
black / blank / half-loaded / still behind a spinner.

The signal is pixel *variance*: a real tweet always has a light header band with
dark text (and usually media), so it has plenty of contrast. A failed capture —
an all-black frame, a blank white frame, or a lone loading spinner — is nearly
uniform, so its standard deviation collapses toward zero. We pair that with a
size floor and a "very dark overall" check.

    good, reason = screenshot_quality(path)   # good=False  -> recapture it

A third failure mode joins those: a shot taken UNDER one of X's modal backdrops.
The dialog itself is caught deterministically in the DOM (see `overlays`), but a
dim layer we did not anticipate would otherwise pass every check above — it has
plenty of contrast, it is just uniformly darkened. The tell is the histogram: a
real tweet sits against a near-white (light theme) or near-black (dark theme)
background, so its pixels pile up at one END of the range. Multiply everything by
a ~0.4 backdrop and that pile lands in the MIDDLE instead, with nothing bright
left at all. That is what `_dimmed` looks for.

    `too-small` is different in kind: it is the image's own height. A frame

    `_crop_box` (`max(cut - frame_top - _TOP_PAD, 80)`) — the sentinel meaning
    the crop computed degenerate. That is an observation, so callers are
