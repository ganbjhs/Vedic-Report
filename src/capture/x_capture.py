"""X (Twitter) capture module.

Opens a post in the logged-in browser and takes ONE clean screenshot of the
tweet itself: header -> text -> media. Everything below the media — the
engagement/action bar (reply/repost/like/view/bookmark) and the aggregate
counts + "time · views" metadata line — is cropped out. Because we clip to the
tweet `article` element (never the full page), the surrounding "your account" UI
is excluded too: the left nav rail, the right sidebar (trends / who-to-follow)
and the reply composer all live outside the article.

WHEN THE LINK IS A REPLY the shot covers the conversation, not just the reply:
X renders the parent above the reply, so the frame runs

    parent name/@handle + text + media  ->  reply text + media

as one continuous image. The parent's own action bar (which would otherwise sit
in the middle of that frame) is hidden before the shot, so no likes/reposts/
replies appear anywhere in the picture. The frame is checked against that
promise before the shot is accepted (`_frame_covers`), so a reply that came out
cropped to its parent is retaken instead of shipped.

`keep_engagement=True` asks for the opposite crop, for reports that are ABOUT
the numbers: the cut moves to just below the focused post's action bar and the
ancestors keep theirs, so a reply comes out as

    parent name/@handle + text + media + like/views  ->  reply text + media
    + like/views

Nothing else changes — same framing, same retakes, same result dict — and the
default is the tight crop above, so a caller that does not ask for this gets
exactly the picture it always got.

Overlays — X's dialogs, sheets and dim backdrops — are cleared by `overlays`
before every take. See that module for why a stray dialog and a mis-framed
reply are the same bug.

Returns:
    {"url", "status", "handle", "screenshot", "text", "overlay", "frame_ok",
     "parent_lost"}
    status : "ok" | "login_wall" | "not_found" | "age_restricted" | "error: …"
    overlay: True when a dialog was STILL over the post when the shot was taken
    frame_ok: False when the frame did not cover what the crop promised
    parent_lost: True when the post HAD an ancestor before the scroll but was
        framed alone anyway — an observed parent loss, not an inference
