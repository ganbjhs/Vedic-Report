# Report Automation — the whole app, browser included.
#
# Chromium runs here, on your own server. That is the original design: no remote
# browser service, no per-minute cap, no extra network hop.
#
# Base: the official Playwright Python image — Chromium and every OS library it
# needs are already installed, and it is published for amd64 AND arm64. That
# avoids the fragile `playwright install --with-deps` step at build time.
# The tag MUST match the playwright version in requirements.txt.
